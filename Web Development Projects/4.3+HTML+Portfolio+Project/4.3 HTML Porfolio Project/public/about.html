<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently studying computer engineering and working on small projects on the side. I have skills in C++, C#, .NET, CSS, HTML, and SQL databases. I enjoy coding with Visual Studio and VS Code. I'm open to any work involving backend development, and even if I don't have the skills yet.
I am committed to working hard and learning to make it possible.</p>
